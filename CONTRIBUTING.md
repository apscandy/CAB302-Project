# Contributing to CAB302-Project

Welcome to CAB302-Project! This project follows a simple Git workflow to keep things organized. Please read the following guidelines before contributing.

## Guidelines for Contributing

### 1. Branching

- **Create a new branch** for each feature you are working on. Name your branch something descriptive that reflects the feature or task (e.g., `feature/login-page` or `bugfix/fix-navbar`).
- **Do not work on the `main` branch**. It is reserved for stable, merged code. All development should happen in separate branches.

### 2. Working on one feature at a time

- **Work on only one feature per branch.** Once you finish one task and are ready to work on a new one, create a new branch for the new feature.
- If you are working on a feature and need to start a different one, make sure to **complete and open a PR** for your current feature first before starting a new one.

### 3. Pull Requests

- When you're ready to merge your changes into `main`, **open a pull request** (PR).
  - Provide a clear description of the changes in your PR.
  - Make sure to resolve any conflicts before opening the PR.
  - If tests or checks are required, ensure all tests pass before merging.
