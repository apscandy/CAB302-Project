## Project requirements

1. **Basic Flashcard Creation**: The ability to easily create and edit flashcards with text-based content. Users should be able to input questions and answers in a straightforward, no-frills interface.

2. **Offline Access**: The app should work fully offline, allowing users to create, edit, and study flashcards without needing an internet connection,

3. **Simple Study Mode**: A basic study mode that allows users to go through their flashcards, flipping between questions and answers. A "mark as learned" feature could help prioritize cards that need further review.

4. **Progress Tracking**: A simple way to track progress, such as how many cards have been reviewed or mastered, or which cards need more study time.

5. **Card Sorting/Organizing**: The ability to organize flashcards into decks or categories, making it easier to focus on specific topics or subjects at a time.

6. **Auto-Shuffle Cards**: A feature that automatically shuffles the flashcards each time the user begins a new study session to prevent memorization based on order and encourage true recall.

7. **Multiple Decks**: The ability to create and organize multiple decks for different subjects or topics, keeping everything organized and easy to manage.

8. **Basic Search Function**: A simple search option that allows users to quickly find a specific flashcard or deck by keyword or title.

9. **Customizable Card Design**: Basic customization options, such as changing font size or color for clarity and comfort, without overwhelming the user.

10. **Simple Export/Backup**: A feature that allows users to back up or export their flashcard decks to a file (such as CSV or text format), so they donâ€™t lose their data if they switch devices or need to make a copy.
