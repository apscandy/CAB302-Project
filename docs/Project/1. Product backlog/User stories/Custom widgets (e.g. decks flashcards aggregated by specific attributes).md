_As a user, I want to generate custom widgets (e.g., decks/flashcards aggregated by specific attributes) so that I can efficiently organize and access relevant content._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **Given** I am on the widget creation page, **when** I select specific attributes (e.g., tags, categories), **then** a custom deck or flashcard widget is generated based on the selected attributes.
2. **Given** I has created a widget, **when** I save it, **then** the widget is added to their dashboard for future use.
3. **Given** I am viewing an existing widget, **when** I update the selected attributes, **then** the widget regenerates with the updated content.

**Priority:** High

**Story Points / Effort:**

**Additional Notes:**
- Ensure the attribute selection interface is user-friendly and intuitive.
- Support multiple attribute filters for greater customization.
- Consider implementing a preview feature before saving the widget.
