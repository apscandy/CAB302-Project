As a user, I want to import a deck so that I can quickly add external collection of cards to my account.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Given** I am logged into my account, **when** I navigate to the “Import Deck” section, **then** I can upload a deck file in supported formats (e.g., .csv, .json).
2. **Given** I have uploaded a deck file, **when** the system processes the file and encounters an issue (e.g., unsupported format, file corruption) then I receive an error message informing me of the failure.
3. **Given** my deck file has been successfully processed, **when** the system loads the data, I can preview the deck, including card names, descriptions, and categories, to confirm the details before completing the import.
4. **Given** I am satisfied with the preview, **when** I click the "Import" button, the deck is saved to my account, and I receive a confirmation message indicating the import was successful.
