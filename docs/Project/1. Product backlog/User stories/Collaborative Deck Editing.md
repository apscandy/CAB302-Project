_As a user, I want to collaborate with other users on creating and editing flashcard decks, so that we can build comprehensive study materials together._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Given** I am a user, **when** I create a new deck, **then** I have the option to make it collaborative.
2. **Given** I have a collaborative deck, **when** I click "Share", **then** I receive a unique URL that I can distribute to potential collaborators.
3. **Given** someone has a collaboration URL, **when** they access the link, **then** they can view or edit the deck based on the permission level without requiring an account.
4. **Given** I have a collaborative deck URL, **when** I set permission levels (view-only, edit access), **then** these permissions apply to anyone using that URL.
5. **Given** multiple users are editing a deck, **when** one user saves changes while another is still editing, **then** the last person to save will override previous changes.
6. **Given** I am editing a collaborative deck, **when** I save my changes, **then** I see a timestamp of when the deck was last updated and by whom.
