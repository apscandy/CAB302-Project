_As a user, I want to navigate between flashcards easily so that I can control my study pace and navigate between cards as I go._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Given** I am studying a deck, **when** I use the navigation button, **then** the app should show the previous or next card accordingly.
2. **Given** I want to skip a card, **when** I use the skip button, **then** the card should be moved to the end of the session queue.
3. **Given** I want to jump to a specific card, **when** I select it from a deck overview, **then** the system should take me directly to that card.
4. **Given** I have completed a session, **when** I navigate back to previous cards, **then** my last viewed position should be saved for later review.
