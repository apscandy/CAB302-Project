**Date**: 26/03/2025
**Time**: 17:10
**Location**: F101
**Facilitator**: Andrew Clarke
**Attendees:** Andrew Clarke, Monica Borg, Lewis Phan, Maverick Doan and David Bui

## **1. Meeting Agenda**
1. Team contract 
2. User stories - discuss new ones and hierarchies added 
3. Sprint plan 
4. UI design 
5. Updates to merge strategy 

## **2. Discussion Points & Key Decisions**
1. **Team Contract:** Contract needs to be in place regarding deliverables and letting people know if we are struggling with work. Implementing a check in period before the task is due. Also allowing time for review in the time it will take for a task to be completed.
2. **User Stories:** A consistent story point weighting system has to be decided throughout the team. The spreadsheet was re-evaluated as a team, and another system was implemented to group user stories together based on their function/closeness in functionality. 
3. **Sprint plan:** See below. 
4. **UI Design:** All okay, photos will be uploaded to docs/gui-design. Monica and Andy will move to completing the medium fidelity design. 
5. **Merge Strategy:** When a feature is finished, we are to no longer merge to main. 
The code will need to be reviewed first, to make sure it is all up to date. 
Once the feature is complete, let Andy or Monica know for review; we will merge. 
Use --f (_Note from Monica - not sure if this line is correct_)

**Other**

6. Make sure we are all pulling before pushing.
7. Add in a skip function for cards. 
8. Testing opens on a new window.
9. When testing is exited/complete, reopen main view.
10. Application name: Cram It

### **2.1 Sprint Planning**
**How Long Is Each Sprint**
Group agrees to trial 1-week sprint to see how manageable it is. Weekends are assigned as review. 

_Monday to Friday: coding_

_Saturday to Sunday: review & debugging_

#### Review Process
Andy and Monica will be doing reviews.
If code fails review, it will not be merged and will be pushed to the next sprint. 

Code can be rejected for:
1. Buggy feature 
2. Code smells 

### 2.2 Sprint 1 Plan 
1. Welcome & login window
2. Main view
