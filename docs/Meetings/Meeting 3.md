## **2. Discussion Points & Key Decisions**
1. **Team Contract:** Contract needs to be in place regarding deliverables and letting people know if we are struggling with work. Implementing a check in period before the task is due. Also allowing time for review in the time it will take for a task to be completed.
2. **User Stories:** A consistent story point weighting system has to be decided throughout the team. 
3. **Sprint plan:** See below. 
4. **UI Design:** all okay, photos will be uploaded to docs/gui-design
5. **Merge Strategy:** when finished features, no longer merge to main. 
Code needs to be reviewed to make sure it is all up to date. 
Once feature is complete, let Andy or Monica know for review; we will merge. 
Use --f

**Other**

6. Make sure we are all pulling before pushing.
7. Add in a skip function for cards. 
8. Testing opens on a new window. 
9. When testing is exited/complete, reopen main view

### **Sprint Plan**
**How Long Is Each Sprint**
Group agrees to trial 1-week sprint to see how manageable it is. Weekends are assigned as review. 

_Monday to Friday: coding_

#### Review Process
