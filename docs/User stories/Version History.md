_As a user, I want to view the version history of my flashcards so that I can restore previous versions if needed._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

2. **Given** I open the version history of a flashcard, **when** I select an earlier version, **then** the content should update to that version.
3. **Given** I am viewing version history, **when** I compare two versions, **then** the system should be able highlight the differences between the selected versions.
4. **Given** I have restored an earlier version, **when** I return to editing, **then** the restored version should be the active one.
