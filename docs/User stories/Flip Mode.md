_As a user, I want to study my flashcards using Flip Mode so that I can test my recall by seeing one side of the card first._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Given** I am in Flip Mode, **when** I tap or click on a flashcard, **then** the card should flip to reveal the other side.
2. **Given** I have flipped a card, **when** I tap or click again, **then** the card should flip back to its original side.
3. **Given** I have a deck with multiple cards, **when** I complete flipping all cards, **then** I should have an option to restart the session or exit.

**Priority:**  
High

**Story Points / Effort:**  
3

**Additional Notes:**  
Time-based Auto Flip can be an add-on.
