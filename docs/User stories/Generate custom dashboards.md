As a user, I want to generate custom dashboards so that I can have a personalized view of the information that matters most to me.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Given** I am on the dashboard creation page, **when** I select specific widgets and data sources, **then** my custom dashboard is created with the selected content.
2. **Given** I have created a dashboard, **when** I save it, **then** it becomes accessible from my account for future use.
3. **Given** I am viewing one of my custom dashboards, **when** I update its settings or layout, **then** the changes are immediately applied and saved.

**Priority:** Medium

**Story Points / Effort:** 8

**Additional Notes:**
- The dashboard layout should support drag-and-drop functionality for easy customization.
- Provide a variety of widget options to cater to different user needs.
