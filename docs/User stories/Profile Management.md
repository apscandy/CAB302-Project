_As a registered user, I want to manage my profile information so that I can keep my account updated._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Given** a user is logged in, **when** they navigate to profile settings, **then** they can view and edit their personal information.
2. **Given** a user is in profile settings, **when** they update their display name, **then** the change is reflected throughout the application.

**Priority:**  
_Low_

**Effort:**  
_2/10_

**Additional Notes:**

- Consider adding theme customization options (light/dark mode)
- Language preference settings should affect the entire application UI (default in English)
