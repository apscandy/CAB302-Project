As a user, I want to access built-in dashboards/widgets so that I can quickly utilize pre-designed tools without the need for customization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Given** I am on the dashboard or widget selection page, **when** I browse the available built-in options, **then** I can preview and select one that suits my needs.
2. **Given** I have selected a built-in dashboard/widget, **when** I add it to my account, **then** it is available for immediate use.
3. **Given** I am using a built-in dashboard/widget, **when** I apply filters or make adjustments, **then** the changes are reflected in real-time without affecting the original design.
