As a user, I want to access built-in analytic charts so that I can quickly visualize and interpret key data insights without creating custom visuals.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Given** I am logged into my account, **when** I navigate to the analytics section, **then** I can view a selection of pre-designed analytic charts that provide insights performance details for each flashcards set and correct/incorrect percentage.
2. **Given** I am analyzing my performance, **when** I view the charts, I can easily interpret the trends and detail using a line graph.

**Priority:** Medium

**Story Points / Effort:** 5

**Additional Notes:**

- Ensure charts are visually clear and easy to interpret, even for non-expert users.

- This line graph will take 2 parameters: the correct and incorrect ratio for the Y axis and the time point for the X axis.
