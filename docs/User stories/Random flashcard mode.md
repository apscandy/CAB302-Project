_As a user I want normal mode that shows cards in a random order, so that I can practice for my subjects_

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **Given** I am about to start a session, **when** I press random mode, **then** a flash card session should start with the flashcards in a random order.
2. **Given** I am in the session, **when** I press _correct_ or _incorrect_, **then** I want that information stored and the next card is shown.
