_As a user, I want to categorise my flashcards with tags or labels so that I can easily filter and find relevant flashcards._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Given** I am editing a flashcard, **when** I add one or more tags, **then** the tags should be saved and displayed with the card.
2. **Given** I am reviewing my flashcards, **when** I apply one or more tag filters, **then** only flashcards with the specified tags should be shown.
3. **Given** I remove a tag from a flashcard, **when** I save changes, **then** the tag should no longer be associated with that card.
4. **Given** I am viewing my flashcards, **when** I want to bookmark or star a flashcard, **then** the card should be highlighted or the bookmark tag should be saved and displayed with the card.

**Priority:**
