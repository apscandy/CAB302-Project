As a user, I want to toggle between dark and light modes so that I can study comfortably in different lighting conditions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Given** I am using the application, **when** I click on the theme toggle button in settings, **then** the application's color scheme should switch between dark and light mode.
2. **Given** I set the application to dark mode, **when** I close and reopen the application, **then** my theme preference should be remembered.
3. **Given** I am in dark mode, **when** I view flashcards, **then** all UI elements should have appropriate contrast and readability.
