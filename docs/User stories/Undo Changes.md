_As a user, I want to undo recent changes to my flashcards so that I can quickly revert accidental edits._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Given** I make an edit to a flashcard, **when** I click the Undo button, **then** the previous state of the flashcard should be restored.
2. **Given** I undo a change, **when** I click Redo, **then** the undone change should be reapplied.
3. **Given** I make multiple edits, **when** I click Undo multiple times, **then** each step should revert only one change at a time.

**Priority:**  
Medium

**Story Points / Effort:**
